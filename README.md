# Blackjack

Taken from [PAGAT](https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html):
> Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).

## Rules
1. Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as 10 points.
2. After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card."
3. Play begins with the player to the dealer's left. The following are the choices available to the player:
  - Hit: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21, then he loses.
  - Stand: Player stands pat with his cards.
  - Double Down: Player doubles his bet and gets one, and only one, more card.
4. After each player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card. If the dealer has 16 or less, then he will draw another card. A special situation is when the dealer has an ace and any number of cards totaling six points (known as a "soft 17").
5. If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win.
6. If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win.
7. Winning wagers pay even money, except a winning player blackjack pays 3 to 2.
